# Weekly Progress Report

**Week:** 11 August 2025 – 18 August 2025


---

## Summary of Activities

### Monday, 11 August 2025

* Explored **ckb-script-templates**, a repository of CKB Rust script templates for native development on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
* Reviewed changes in **Molecule 0.8.0**, including the switch from `Vec` to `bytes` and implications for RISC-V atomic instructions.
* Studied solutions for molecule atomic issues:

  * Enable `dummy-atomic` feature in `ckb-std` and update `FULL_RUSTFLAGS`.
  * Enable `bytes_vec` feature in molecule crate.

### Tuesday, 12 August 2025

* Reviewed dependencies: Unix utilities, Rust with `riscv64` target, Clang 18+, and `cargo-generate`.
* Learned to create a workspace template using:

```bash
cargo generate gh:cryptape/ckb-script-templates workspace
```

### Wednesday, 13 August 2025

* Generated first workspace project and explored its structure:

```
.
├── Cargo.toml
├── Makefile
├── scripts/
└── tests/
```

* Understood the purpose of Makefile and scripts folder for contract building.

### Thursday, 14 August 2025

* Created first contract crate inside the workspace using `make generate`.
* Learned custom contract names and templates:

```bash
make generate CRATE=second-contract
make generate TEMPLATE=atomics-contract
make generate TEMPLATE=c-wrapper-crate DESTINATION=crates
```

* Explored prebuilt templates: `contract`, `stack-reorder-contract`, `c-wrapper-crate`, `x64-simulator-crate`, `atomics-contract`.

### Friday, 15 August 2025

* Built and tested contracts using Makefile commands:

```bash
make build
make build MODE=debug
make build CONTRACT=second-contract
make test
```

* Reviewed best practices for reproducible builds using Docker scripts.

### Saturday, 16 August 2025

* Explored standalone contract crate creation:

```bash
cargo generate gh:cryptape/ckb-script-templates standalone-contract
```

* Built and tested standalone crate: `make build`, `make test`, `make check`, `make clippy`.

### Sunday, 17 August 2025

* Learned about native simulator generation for debugging contracts:

```bash
make generate-native-simulator CRATE=<subproject_name>
```

* Practiced generating simulators and understood CRATE parameter constraints.

### Monday, 18 August 2025

* Reviewed workspace vs standalone contract creation, template customization, build parameters, and reproducible build best practices.
* Prepared environment for next week’s contract implementation exercises.

## Challenges & Notes

* Configuring molecule atomic features required careful attention to Rust flags.
* Learning workspace conventions and Makefile commands was essential for smooth contract generation.
* Standalone contracts offer flexibility but are less integrated with workspace conventions.

---

## Goals for Next Week

* Start implementing simple contracts using generated templates.
* Apply reproducible build practices for consistent contract binaries.
* Explore native simulator for testing contract logic before deployment.
