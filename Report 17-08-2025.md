# Weekly Progress Report  

**Week:** 17 August 2025 â€“ 24 August 2025

## Summary of Activities  

### Sunday, 17 August 2025  
- Studied the **Script-Sourced Rich Information (SSRI)** solution:  
  - Extended script capabilities with off-chain execution returning results.  
  - Learned how SSRI allows embedding logic/data inside scripts for off-chain apps.  
  - Reviewed **behavior standards**: traits, method constraints, and off-chain syscall categories (Code, Script, Cell, Transaction).  

### Monday, 18 August 2025  
- Explored **method paths** in SSRI:  
  - Defined as first 8 bytes of CKB hash of method signature.  
  - Learned about format `[<trait>.]<method>` (e.g., `UDT.symbol`).  
  - Understood why SSRI does not support overloading.  
- Reviewed distribution mechanism via program entry (`__ckb_std_main`) and use of `argv`.  

### Tuesday, 19 August 2025  
- Reviewed **off-chain syscalls** differences from on-chain:  
  - `find_out_point_by_type`, `find_cell_by_out_point`, `find_cell_data_by_out_point`.  
  - Noted environment levels: Code, Script, Cell, Transaction.  
- Understood how undefined method paths and errors are handled in SSRI-compliant scripts.  

### Wednesday, 20 August 2025  
- Studied **SSRI Trait Design**:  
  - `SSRI.version`, `SSRI.get_methods`, `SSRI.has_methods`, `SSRI.get_cell_deps`.  
  - Encoding standards (little-endian numbers, utf-8 strings, molecule composite encoding).  
- Compared workspace of **UDT Trait** under SSRI.  

### Thursday, 21 August 2025  
- Explored **UDT Trait under SSRI**:  
  - `balance() -> u128`  
  - `name() -> Bytes`  
  - `symbol() -> Byte`  
  - `decimals() -> u8`  
- Understood how SSRI ensures **interoperability and standardized UDT behaviors**.  

### Friday, 22 August 2025  
- Deep dive into **xUDT Data Structures**:  
  - Backward compatibility with **sUDT**.  
  - Extended `args` structure with flags + extension data.  
  - ScriptVec extension and validation flows.  
- Learned about **Owner Mode update**:  
  - Support for more flexible validation rules.  
  - Use of `owner_script` and `owner_signature` in witness.  

### Saturday, 23 August 2025  
- Studied **xUDT Witness & Operations**:  
  - `XudtWitnessInput` fields (owner_script, signature, raw_extension_data, extension_data).  
  - Validation with Raw Extension Script mode vs P2SH-style extension script mode.  
  - Owner Mode without consuming cell (optimization to skip extra inputs).  

### Sunday, 24 August 2025  
- Reviewed **deployment details** of xUDT:  
  - Confirmed mainnet (Mirana) and testnet (Pudge) deployment parameters.  
  - Learned reproducible build process with `ckb-production-scripts`.  
- Summarized SSRI, UDT Trait, and xUDT spec as the foundation for **next phase: contract implementation & testing**.

## Challenges & Notes  

- Understanding **method path hashing** and its restriction on method overloading required careful study.  
- The **off-chain syscall categorization** (Code, Script, Cell, Transaction) was complex but essential for SSRI execution model.  
- **xUDT extension logic** is flexible but introduces complexity in validation (especially when multiple extensions interact).  
- Owner mode changes in xUDT are powerful but require careful witness handling.
