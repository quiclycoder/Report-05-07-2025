##  Summary of Activities

###  **Monday, 21 July 2025**
- Began working on **Rust ownership** concepts.
- Started the `06_move_semantics` module from Rustlings.
- Learned:
  - Ownership transfer (moves) between variables and functions.
  - Basic borrowing with references (`&`) and mutable references (`&mut`).

---

###  **Tuesday, 22 July 2025**
- Continued progressing through the `move_semantics` exercises.
- Corrected ownership-related errors:
  - Used `.clone()` when necessary to avoid move errors.
  - Modified values using `&mut` inside functions.

---

###  **Wednesday, 23 July 2025**
- Completed the full `move_semantics` module.
- Summarized key concepts:
  - Ownership vs Borrowing.
  - Stack vs Heap allocation in Rust.
- Took notes in preparation for the next section on Traits and Lifetimes.

---

###  **Thursday, 24 July 2025**
- Started exploring **Traits** in Rust.
- Read documentation and followed examples:
  - Implemented `Display` and custom traits on user-defined types.
- Practiced using `trait bounds` in generic functions.

---

###  **Friday, 25 July 2025**
- Worked through exercises involving **lifetimes**.
- Understood lifetime annotations and their purpose in avoiding dangling references.
- Practiced functions with reference parameters and explicit lifetime definitions.

---

###  **Saturday, 26 July 2025**
- Continued refining understanding of lifetimes.
- Studied common lifetime-related compiler errors and how to resolve them.
- Compared lifetime management in Rust vs garbage collection in JavaScript.

---

###  **Sunday, 27 July 2025**
- Reviewed all learned topics (ownership, traits, lifetimes).
- Applied concepts by building a small CLI Rust app with trait-based design.
- Started experimenting with closures and higher-order functions.

---

###  **Monday, 28 July 2025**
- Finalized the week's practice with:
  - A summary notebook on key Rust patterns.
  - A comparison between Rust‚Äôs memory safety and JavaScript‚Äôs GC model.
- Planned out next week‚Äôs focus on **closures** and **error handling** in Rust.

---

##  Challenges & Notes
- Understanding lifetimes took significant effort but was clarified through visual examples and practice.
- Rust‚Äôs compiler continues to enforce safe memory management, reinforcing clean design thinking.
- Trait-based abstractions are powerful but require patience to fully understand in generic contexts.

---

##  Goals for Next Week
- Master **closures** and functional patterns in Rust.
- Start working on **error handling** with `Result` and `Option`.
- Begin exploring how to apply Rust in blockchain smart contract development (e.g., with Capsule for CKB).
