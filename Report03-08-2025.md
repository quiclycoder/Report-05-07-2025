# 🗓️ Weekly Progress Report  
**Week:** 29 July 2025 – 3 August 2025  

---

## ✅ Summary of Activities

### 📅 **Tuesday, 29 July 2025**
- Completed **Chapter 5: Using Structs to Structure Related Data** from *The Rust Programming Language*:
  - Defined and instantiated custom `struct`s.
  - Created a program to calculate the area of rectangles using structs.
  - Implemented associated methods with `impl` blocks and used `&self` for referencing.

---

### 📅 **Wednesday, 30 July 2025**
- Finished **Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching**:
  - Defined enums with multiple variants, including `Option` and custom types.
  - Used `match` expressions for exhaustive pattern matching.
  - Practiced with `if let` and `let else` for more concise control flow.
  - Completed the *Ownership Inventory #1* exercise.

---

### 📅 **Thursday, 31 July 2025**
- Began exploring the **CKB Contract Creation (CCC) Playground**:  
  - Visited [live.ckbccc.com](https://live.ckbccc.com) and initialized the environment.
  - Reviewed the interface and tested basic contract templates in Rust.
  - Started mapping Rust language features to CKB VM constraints.

---

### 📅 **Friday, 1 August 2025**
- Deployed a basic contract using the CCC Playground:
  - Customized template code and built the contract.
  - Ran unit tests directly in the browser-based environment.
  - Investigated how CKB-VM executes Rust code via RISC-V compilation.

---

### 📅 **Saturday, 2 August 2025**
- Continued experimenting with CKB smart contracts:
  - Used Rust’s `no_std` environment in the CCC Playground.
  - Learned how to log outputs, return success codes, and handle panics.
  - Analyzed structure of entry functions (`main`, `entry`, `validate`).

---

### 📅 **Sunday, 3 August 2025**
- Wrapped up the week's progress with:
  - A complete test cycle: write → compile → run → debug.
  - Notes comparing standard Rust development vs smart contract constraints (e.g., no heap, limited libraries).
  - Identified need to strengthen understanding of low-level memory management and error handling.

---

## ⚠️ Challenges & Notes
- Moving from general Rust to CKB-specific smart contract development introduced new constraints like `no_std` and limited tooling.
- The CCC Playground made it easier to test code without local setup, but required adapting to a different dev workflow.
- Pattern matching and ownership concepts were useful when handling enums and return values in contract functions.

---

## 🎯 Goals for Next Week
- Dive deeper into Capsule framework for compiling and deploying CKB contracts locally.
- Learn how to write unit and integration tests for on-chain contracts.
- Explore how transaction scripts interact with the blockchain and how to simulate full transaction validation.
