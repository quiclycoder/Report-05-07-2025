## **Summary of Activities**  

### **Sunday, 3 August 2025**  
- Explored **CCC - CKBers' Codebase**, a unified solution for developing in the **CKB JS/TS ecosystem**.  
- Learned about CCCâ€™s role in:  
  - Enabling interoperability with wallets from multiple blockchain ecosystems.  
  - Unlocking **CKBâ€™s Turing completeness** and cryptographic freedom.  
- Reviewed CCC **use cases**:  
  - Learning CKB via examples and demos.  
  - Analyzing blockchain data.  
  - Composing transactions with helper utilities.  
  - Unified signing for multiple chains.  
  - Wallet integration via pre-built or custom UIs.

### **Monday, 4 August 2025**  
- Tested **CCC Playground**, a browser-based environment for code execution and visualization.  
- Explored features for:  
  - Code sharing.  
  - Live output visualization.  
  - Testing transaction composition workflows.  
- Reviewed Playground UI guide for interface elements.  

---

### **Tuesday, 5 August 2025**  
- Learned **Quick Start with `create-ccc-app`** using:  
  - `npx create-ccc-app@latest my-ccc-app`  
  - `yarn create ccc-app my-ccc-app`  
  - `pnpm create ccc-app my-ccc-app`  
- Understood framework template selection process.  
- Began **manual installation** workflow for CCC packages:  
  - `@ckb-ccc/shell` for Node.js tools.  
  - `@ckb-ccc/ccc` for custom UI.  
  - `@ckb-ccc/connector` for web components.  
  - `@ckb-ccc/connector-react` for React integrations.  

---

### **Wednesday, 6 August 2025**  
- Studied **CCC object exports** for code completion.  
- Learned about `cccA` advanced exports for deep customization (unstable API).  
- Practiced importing both basic and advanced CCC modules.  

---

### **Thursday, 7 August 2025**  
- Explored **Transaction Composing** in CCC:  
  - Built a minimal transaction with `ccc.Transaction.from()`.  
  - Added transaction outputs and completed inputs using `.completeInputsByCapacity(signer)`.  
  - Automatically calculated fees with `.completeFeeBy(signer)`.  
  - Sent transaction via `signer.sendTransaction(tx)`.  
- Reviewed the **full native CKB token transfer example**.  

---

### **Friday, 8 August 2025**  
- Learned how to **build and run CCC demos**:  
  - Installed dependencies and built the project using `pnpm install` & `pnpm build`.  
  - Started demo in development mode with `pnpm run dev`.  

---

### **Saturday, 9 August 2025**  
- Studied **common CCC issues and fixes**:  
  - TypeScript module resolution for CCCâ€™s package entry points.  
  - Adding `"use client"` for CCC UI in React Server Components.  
- Explored **Lumos patches** for wallet compatibility:  
  - JoyID, Nostr, and Portal Wallet support.  
  - Applied patches with `generateDefaultScriptInfos()` before using Lumos.  

---

## **Challenges & Notes**  
- Adjusting **TypeScript settings** for CCC exports was essential to avoid property access errors.  
- Learned that CCC UI must run client-side in React to avoid runtime errors.  
- Transaction composition in CCC felt intuitive after understanding the helper methods.
