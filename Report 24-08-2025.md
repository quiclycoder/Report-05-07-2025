# Weekly Progress Report

**Week:** 24 August 2025 – 31 August 2025   

---

## Summary of Activities

### Sunday, 24 August 2025  
- Read the introduction of the **RGB++ Protocol Light Paper (Draft)**.  
- Studied the motivation for extending the RGB protocol with **single-use seals** and **client-side validation**.  
- Compared the interoperability challenges of RGB vs. RGB++.

---

### Monday, 25 August 2025  
- Focused on **Single-Use Seals** and their role in mapping Bitcoin UTXOs to CKB Cells.  
- Learned how Bitcoin’s consensus enforces one-time usage, preventing double-spending in RGB++.  
- Reviewed the **Client-Side Validation** mechanism for off-chain computation.

---

### Tuesday, 26 August 2025  
- Explored problems with the original RGB protocol, including:  
  - **Decentralized Authentication (DA) issues**.  
  - **P2P network dependencies**.  
  - **Virtual machine/tooling immaturity**.  
- Studied how **isomorphic bindings** in RGB++ map UTXOs to CKB Cells.  
- Took notes on how RGB++ enhances validation using **synchronized transactions on BTC and CKB**.

---

### Wednesday, 27 August 2025  
- Reviewed the **RGB++ Transaction Process**:  
  - Off-chain computation & commitments.  
  - BitcoinTXsubmission with OP_RETURN.  
  - CKB TX submission for state maintenance.  
  - On-chain verification steps across both BTC & CKB.  
- Learned how **Transaction Folding** improves scalability by linking multiple CKB TXs to a single BTC TX.

---

### Thursday, 28 August 2025  
- Studied advanced topics:  
  - **Shared State and Unhosted Contracts** (Intent Cell mechanism).  
  - **Non-Interactive Transfers** using CKB locks to avoid invoices.  
  - **Coins and NFTs issuance** with xUDT, Spore, and CoTA standards.  
  - Privacy enhancements using **bulletproofs** and **ring signatures**.  
- Summarized key applications of RGB++:  
  - **DEX & AMM** for UTXO assets.  
  - **Lightning Network compatibility** for RGB++ stablecoin payments.  

---

### Friday, 29 August 2025  
- Revisited sections of the Light Paper on **isomorphic bindings** for deeper clarity.  
- Drafted personal notes to explain the **dual-chain validation** model in simpler terms.  
- Compared RGB++ with other interoperability models (e.g., bridged assets, sidechains).  

---

### Saturday, 30 August 2025  
- Studied the **Intent Cell** mechanism in more detail.  
- Learned how it enables **cross-application shared state** without centralized servers.  
- Took notes on the relationship between **Intent Cells** and **non-interactive transfers**.  

---

### Sunday, 31 August 2025  
- Reviewed **bulletproofs and ring signatures** for privacy in RGB++.  
- Focused on how privacy is achieved **without compromising validation guarantees**.  
- Consolidated notes on the **practical use cases**:  
  - Stablecoin transfers over Lightning.  
  - NFT issuance with Spore & CoTA.  
  - Decentralized trading via DEX & AMM.  

---

## Challenges & Notes
- The paper is **dense and highly technical**, requiring careful rereading of some sections.  
- Understanding **isomorphic bindings** and the **dual-chain validation model** was the most challenging.  
- Needed extra time to connect theory with **practical use cases** like airdrops, DEX, and non-interactive transfers.

---

## Goals for Next Week
- Revisit the **examples and diagrams** in the Light Paper for deeper clarity.  
- Start drafting a **summary document** with simplified explanations of RGB++ concepts.  
- Explore connections between **RGB++ and CKB smart contract tooling** (ckb-std, molecule).
