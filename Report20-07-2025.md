Summary of Activities


Sunday, 13 July 2025

Learned how to create methods inside JavaScript classes.

Practiced using getters, setters, and method chaining.

Completed class-based exercises and reviewed external examples for deeper understanding.



Monday, 14 July 2025

Installed CKB JavaScript SDK libraries using:
npm install @nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-core @nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-rpc blake2b

Explored core components of the SDK, including CKB, Address, and Script classes.

Initialized a connection to a testnet RPC node.



Tuesday, 15 July 2025

Built a basic transaction using the JavaScript SDK.

Loaded a testnet private key using the SDK’s Key module.

Used rpc.getCells to collect inputs and rpc.sendTransaction to broadcast the transaction.



Wednesday, 16 July 2025

Analyzed the code structure of transaction scripts.

Reviewed the relationship between cell capacity and contract binary size.

Researched how to calculate code_hash and reuse existing smart contracts on-chain.



Thursday, 17 July 2025

Revisited JavaScript object methods and class instance methods for clarity.

Built sample code to reinforce understanding of method scopes.

Logged errors and behaviors using Chrome DevTools for debugging the SDK more effectively.



Friday, 18 July 2025

Continued experimenting with SDK transactions and various input/output configurations.

Investigated how dependencies are declared and used in transactions.

Explored additional RPC methods for monitoring transaction status.



Saturday, 19 July 2025

Started outlining a basic custom script for devnet deployment.

Reviewed CKB lock script concepts and signature validation mechanisms.

Compared different script formats and tested serialization logic.



Sunday, 20 July 2025

Refined test transaction scripts with enhanced error handling.

Set up a workspace for developing and testing custom lock scripts.

Documented key SDK behaviors and started preparing for custom script signing.



Challenges & Notes
Differentiating between object methods and class instance methods took focused practice.

Understanding the abstractions in the CKB SDK (cells, capacity, scripts) required combining documentation with hands-on trial and error.

Debugging was much smoother after integrating proper logging and using Chrome DevTools.



Goals for Next Week
Continue building more advanced transactions using the JavaScript SDK.

Begin implementing and deploying a custom script to the devnet.

Learn how to sign and validate transactions using custom lock scripts.
