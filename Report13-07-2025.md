Weekly Progress Report
Week: 5 July 2025 – 13 July 2025

Summary of Activities
5 July 2025

Finalized synchronization of the CKB Devnet node.

Verified peer connections and block propagation using logs and CLI tools.

Commands used:

bash
Copy
Edit
./ckb-cli rpc sync_state  
./ckb-cli rpc get_peers  
tail -f ~/.ckb_dev/logs/ckb.log  


6 July 2025

Followed Nervos documentation to run smart contract labs on the Devnet.

Deployed the first test smart contract to a local Devnet instance.

Began exploring the Nervos CKB SDK and TypeScript environment setup.

Commands used:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/nervosnetwork/ckb-sdk-js  
yarn install  
yarn build  


7 July 2025

Created and funded test accounts using ckb-cli for smart contract interactions.

Tested contract deployment and transaction flow.

Observed logs and RPC responses to confirm correct execution.

Commands used:

bash
Copy
Edit
./ckb-cli account new  
./ckb-cli wallet transfer  
./ckb-cli tx send


8 July 2025

Automated part of the node setup and configuration process via bash scripting.

Scripts include installation checks, environment setup, and node start commands.

Commands used:

bash
Copy
Edit
nano setup-devnet.sh  
chmod +x setup-devnet.sh  
./setup-devnet.sh  


9 July 2025

Began learning Rust basics to prepare for contract development on CKB VM.

Completed introductory exercises covering variables, ownership, and functions.

Used Rust Playground and local Rust installation for hands-on testing.

Commands used:

bash
Copy
Edit
rustc hello.rs  
cargo new rust-ckb-test  
cargo run  
10 July 2025

Explored Nervos capsule framework for developing contracts in Rust.

Installed necessary dependencies and examined example capsule projects.

Commands used:

bash
Copy
Edit
cargo install capsule  
capsule new my-contract  
capsule build  

11–13 July 2025

Continued smart contract lab progression.

Integrated TypeScript-based front-end with CKB backend to simulate dApp interactions.

Researched CKB Indexer and Lumos for better transaction management and querying.


Challenges & Notes
Smart contract tooling is still evolving, requiring careful environment configuration.

Rust's learning curve is manageable but requires focused practice, especially for CKB-specific patterns.

dApp integration required multiple steps and configuration tweaks for full compatibility with the Devnet.


Goals for Next Week
Complete all remaining smart contract lab exercises.

Build and test a minimal full-stack dApp on the CKB Devnet.

Deepen Rust knowledge focusing on CKB-compatible smart contract design.

Explore and document use of Lumos and CKB Indexer for efficient dApp development.
